In react, HTML code is written in JavaScript file(JSX)
The JavaScript files and not explicitly mentioned in the index.html(main html) but it gets added when loading the page automatically because the html is transformed and then loaded
React project uses a build process before it can be installed or used anywhere.
Raw and unprocessed react code wont execute in the browser.
The code will not be optimised/minified in production.
Node JS and used behind the scenes to make sure your React code gets transformed.

for import and export keywords to work in a JavaScript project you have to be using the module keyword in the index.html file. 
<script src="assets/scripts/App.js" type="module"></script>

in javascript you cannot have two default statements 

in react, we must have one component/one javascript function per file. and this one component function is exported using the statement :
	export default ComponentName;
